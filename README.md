# RabbitCommiter

RabbitCommiter is a command-line tool to generate multiple empty commits in a Git repository, distributed randomly between two dates. It's useful for backfilling history, testing CI/CD pipelines, or maintaining contribution streaks. The script is fully interactive and supports Windows, Linux, and MacOS.

## Features
- Generate up to **1000** empty commits between two chosen dates
- Cross-platform support (Windows, Linux, MacOS)
- Random commit messages for each commit
- Fully interactive operation (dates, amount, OS, push)
- Initializes the Git repository and adds remote if needed
- Automatically creates an initial commit if the repository is new
- Only works on `main` or `master` branches
- Option to automatically push to the remote repository
- Date and commit count validation

## Requirements
- Python 3.6+
- Git installed and available in your system's PATH
- (Optional) An initialized Git repository (the script can initialize one for you)

## How to use
1. **Clone or download this repository.**
2. **Open the terminal in the project folder.**
3. **Run the script:**
   ```bash
   python main.py
   ```
4. **Follow the interactive prompts:**
   - Confirm your operating system
   - Enter the start and end dates in `DD:MM:YYYY` format (e.g., 02:04:2024)
   - Enter the number of empty commits to generate (0-1000)
   - Choose whether to push to the remote repository
   - If there is no Git repository, the script can initialize one and ask for the remote URL

## Example
```
$ python main.py

üîç Detected OS: Windows
üíª Is this correct? (Y/n): y
üìÖ Start date (DD:MM:YYYY): 01:05:2024
üìÖ End date (DD:MM:YYYY): 10:05:2024
üî¢ Number of commits (0-1000): 20
üöÄ Do you want to push to remote repository? (Y/n): y
```

## Commit messages
Commit messages are randomly chosen from options like:
- Empty commit for history
- Backfill commit
- Placeholder commit
- Sync point
- Maintenance commit
- Code style improvements
- Update documentation
- Refactor code
- Fix typo
- Optimize performance

## Notes and tips
- The script must be run from the root of a Git repository.
- Only works on the `main` or `master` branch.
- Commit dates are distributed randomly within the informed interval.
- If there is no Git repository, the script can initialize one and ask for the remote URL.
- If the push fails, the script will show the command for manual push.
- If you encounter permission or environment errors, make sure Git is installed and accessible.
- The script validates the date format and the number of commits.

## Troubleshooting
- **"No Git repository found"**: The script offers to initialize a repository automatically.
- **"You're on branch 'X'"**: Switch to the `main` or `master` branch to use the script.
- **Push errors**: Check the remote URL and your access permissions.
- **Invalid dates**: Always use the `DD:MM:YYYY` format.
